# prosumma

You probably don't need this. It's a grab bag shared library used by my other Haskell projects. It makes extensive, opinionated use of [RIO](https://www.fpcomplete.com/haskell/library/rio/).

Why is it open source? Why not? My philosophy is that open source should be the default. Closed source should be chosen only for commercial software and even then only if there's no other alternative.
